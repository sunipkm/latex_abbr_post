\section*{Chapter About Seeing}
Let's define some terms. Line of sight (LOS) is something we use every day while looking -- whether using eyes, or charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors. Eyes provide excellent dynamic range. CCDs on the other hand, require a lot of power to operate, but provide excellent dynamic range. CMOS sensors are the most power efficient, but have the worst dynamic range. The dynamic range of a sensor is the ratio of the brightest to the darkest light intensity that can be captured by the sensor. The dynamic range of the human eye is about 10 orders of magnitude.
